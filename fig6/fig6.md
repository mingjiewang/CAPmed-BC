The plots of Figure6 were  screenshots from the CAPmed-BC website (https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn/analysis), while the statistical plots were generated by uisng R codes. Acetylene and lactylobme data were shown in Figure6. The codes were stored in different folders.

1. [acetylome](./acetylome)
2. [lactylome](./lactylome)

While in each folder, the following R codes were included.

1. Diffenertial_expression.R

   Generate heatmap and volcano plot.

2. GO_KEGG.R

   Generate functional enrichment results, including bubble plot.

4. PPI.R 

   Generate protein-protein interaction network.

5. Single_gene_expression.R

   Generate gene expression boxplot.
