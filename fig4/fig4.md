The plots of Figure4 were all screenshots from the CAPmed-BC website (https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn/analysis), while the statistical plots were generated by uisng R codes. The whole transcriptome data analysis results were shown in Fiugre4, which includes mRNA, lncRNA and circRNA data. The codes for different types of RNA were stored in different folders.

1. [mrna](./mrna)
2. [lncrna](./lncrna)
3. [circrna](./circrna)

While in each folder, the following R codes were included.

1. Diffenertial_expression.R

   Generate heatmap and volcano plot.

2. GO_KEGG.R

   Generate functional enrichment results, including bubble plot.

3. GSEA.R

   Generate geneset enrichment analysis results.

4. PPI.R (only for mRNA)

   Generate protein-protein interaction network.

5. Single_gene_expression.R

   Generate gene expression boxplot.

6. Query_lncRNA(circRNA)_information.R (only for circRNA and lncRNA)

   Query RNA information from the database file.
