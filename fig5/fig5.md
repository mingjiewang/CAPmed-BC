The plots of Figure5 were all screenshots from the CAPmed-BC website (https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn/analysis), while the statistical plots were generated by uisng R codes. Protome and phosphorylome data were shown in Figure5.. The codes were stored in different folders.

1. [protome](./protome)
2. [phosphorylome](./phosphorylome)

While in each folder, the following R codes were included.

1. Diffenertial_expression.R

   Generate heatmap and volcano plot.

2. GO_KEGG.R

   Generate functional enrichment results, including bubble plot.

3. GSEA.R (not applicable for phosphorylome data)

   Generate geneset enrichment analysis results.

4. PPI.R 

   Generate protein-protein interaction network.

5. Single_gene_expression.R

   Generate gene expression boxplot.
